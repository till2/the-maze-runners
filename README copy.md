# MAPF_Problem
Seminar project

Team: Lkhagvasuren Rentsenbyamba, Felix Kratzsch 
## Project: MAPF with pruning in ASP
### Goal
Using ASP to simplify and solve MAPF instances.

### Details
- You need to create an ASP encoding solving MAPF instances (in the mif format). Your encoding must define a subgraph of the instance and non-conflicting paths for the agents on this subgraph. The use of multiple encodings, python scripts, or multi-shot solving is allowed but discouraged.
- You will be given some instances to test on. You don't need a complete encoding to validate the project.
- You should work in a group of two. Make a git repo for your group containing your encoding and a Readme containing the members of your group, a description of your encoding, and other interesting information (how to use it, unsolvable instances, etc). Send me a link to your repo as soon as possible, so I can take a look and help if needed.
- The deadline is the 13th of February.
